Dataset referenced in article: (include reference below) "Rice-distributed autoregressive time series modeling of magnitude functional MRI data"

The ".RData" files provide the MR images acquired with TR = 1.0 s during a block design experiment. The design included 
an initial 16 s rest period followed by 19 epochs of 16 s of right-hand tapping alternating with 16 s of rest. The data were acquired with the 
body coil. 

Each file consists an array of either real- or the imaginary-valued data. The number in the file name corresponds to the axial slice order
